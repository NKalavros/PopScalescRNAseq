1. Run models through helical
    - Perform comparisons between my code and Helical - Done for Geneformer

2. Evaluate inter study integration
    - Compare foundation models
    - Compare with scANVI, scPoli, Symphonypy, CellHint

3. Complete embeddings for rest of the studies - Done

4. Add scMamba, mamba-ssm based packages, and transcriptformer - I don't care that much.

5. Run the models on PanPDAC - Ugh.
